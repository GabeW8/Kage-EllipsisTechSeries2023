# Kage-EllipsisTechSeries2023
Team Kage's solution for the Ellipsis Tech Series Hackathon 2023.

Kage is a portal for companies to sign up and list available jobs or roles for youths to apply and shadow in. The portal will have features such as
- Filtering by industry, interest, duration
- Students to create and edit their profile, including some personal information (picture, level of education, interest)
- Job recommendations based on indicated interests 
- Students applying to jobs
- Companies to list their job (includes job description and potential skills they would be exposed to) for shadowing
- Companies can also write feedback on students who do well
- Gamification element eg. complete 5 job shadowing badge, new skill attained.

These features will be coded out in Flask, making use of SOA layers. 

For the frontend, we will make up a wireframe on Figma first, before coding out our frontend using HTML, CSS & JavaScript using frameworks like Vue.js and Bootstrap. They are chosen as we have gained familiarity with these languages and frameworks from our projects in the past, and as such can implement our solution the best. 

Lastly, we will host our website on Firebase. Firebase is chosen as they have built-in authentication we can use to ensure security for our website. It also allows us to scale up the website to handle more users if the bandwidth needed exceeds a certain amount.
